89,CREATE WBS,Has_Technics_Tools,decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into smaller more manageable parts. the work package is the work deﬁned at the lowest level of the wbs for which cost and duration can be estimated and managed. the level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to effectively manage the project. the level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project. decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work structuring and organizing the wbs decomposing the upper wbs levels into lowerlevel detailed components developing and assigning identiﬁcation codes to the wbs components and verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate. a portion of a wbs with some branches of the wbs decomposed down through the work package level is shown in figure . . value management system project . . . . needs standards systems project assessment development engineering management .. .. .. .. current system requirements alternatives system requirements audit determination development development ... ... ... components gap alternatives identification assessment identification ... ... ... components

is the only way to organize a wbs on this type of project. figure . sample wbs decomposed down through work packages part guide a wbs structure may be created through various approaches. some of the popular methods include the topdown approach the use of organizationspeciﬁc guidelines and the use of wbs templates. a bottomup approach can be used to group subcomponents. the wbs structure can be represented in a number of forms such as using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition with the product and project deliverables inserted at the third level as shown in figure using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition as shown in figure and incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team such as contracted work. the seller then develops the supporting contract wbs as part of the contracted work. software product release . project product detail integration construct management requirements

system system the wbs is illustrative only. it is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project nor to imply that this is the only way to organize a wbs on this type of project. figure . sample wbs with major deliverables decomposition of the upperlevel wbs components requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or subcomponents into its most fundamental components where the wbs components represent veriﬁable products services or results. if an agile approach is used epics can be decomposed into user stories. the wbs may be structured as an outline an organizational chart or other method that identiﬁes a hierarchical breakdown. verifying the correctness of the decomposition requires determining that the lowerlevel wbs components are those that are necessary and sufﬁcient for completion of the corresponding higherlevel deliverables. different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. to arrive at a work package the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level while others need additional levels of decomposition. as the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail the ability to plan manage and control the work is enhanced. however excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort inefﬁcient use of resources decreased efﬁciency in performing the work and difﬁculty aggregating data over different levels of the wbs. decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future. the project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on so the details of the wbs can be developed. this technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning. part guide the wbs represents all product and project work including the project management work. the total of the work at the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. this is sometimes called the percent rule. for speciﬁc information regarding the wbs refer to the practice standard for work breakdown structures second edition . this standard contains industryspeciﬁc examples of wbs templates that can be tailored to speciﬁc projects in a particular application area. ,, decomposition ,",decomposition,deliverables

100,SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES,Has_Technics_Tools,the precedence diagramming method pdm is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which the activities are to be performed. pdm includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. a predecessor activity is an activity that logically comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. a successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after another activity in a schedule. these relationships are deﬁned below and are illustrated in figure finishtostart fs. a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has ﬁnished. for example installing the operating system on a pc successor cannot start until the pc hardware is assembled predecessor. finishtofinish ff. a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity has ﬁnished. for example writing a document predecessor is required to ﬁnish before editing the document successor can ﬁnish. starttostart ss. a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has started. for example level concrete successor cannot begin until pour foundation predecessor begins. starttofinish sf. a logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot ﬁnish until a predecessor activity has started. for example a new accounts payable system successor has to start before the old accounts payable system can be shut down predecessor. in pdm fs is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. the sf relationship is very rarely used but is included to present a complete list of the pdm relationship types. two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time for example ss and ff. multiple relationships between the same activities are not recommended so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the highest impact. closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships. finish to start fs activity a activity b activity a activity a start to start ss finish to finish ff activity b activity b start to finish sf activity a activity b figure . precedence diagramming method pdm relationship types part guide ,, precedence diagramming method ,",method,method,precedence,method,method",",is,takes,have,assumes,is",",number,responsibility,total,project,project schedule"
101,SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES,Has_Technics_Tools,dependencies may be characterized by the following attributes mandatory or discretionary internal or external as described below. dependency has four attributes but two can be applicable at the same time in the following ways mandatory external dependencies mandatory internal dependencies discretionary external dependencies or discretionary internal dependencies. mandatory dependencies. mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work. mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations such as on a construction project where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built or on an electronics project where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. mandatory dependencies are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. technical dependencies may not be mandatory. the project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities. mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. discretionary dependencies. discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic preferential logic or soft logic. discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best practices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a speciﬁc sequence is desired even though there may be other acceptable sequences. for example generally accepted best practices recommend that during construction the electrical work should start after ﬁnishing the plumbing work. this order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time in parallel but performing the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. discretionary dependencies should be fully documented since they can create arbitrary total ﬂoat values and can limit later scheduling options. when fast tracking techniques are employed these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered for modiﬁcation or removal. the project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the process of sequencing the activities. external dependencies. external dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non project activities. these dependencies are usually outside of the project teams control. for example the testing activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source or governmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction project. the project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of sequencing the activities. internal dependencies. internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and are generally inside the project teams control. for example if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble it there is an internal mandatory dependency. the project management team determines which dependencies are internal during the process of sequencing the activities. ,, dependency determination and integration ,",dependency",",has",",attributes"

105,ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS,Has_Technics_Tools,analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project. analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous similar project such as duration budget size weight and complexity as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future project. when estimating durations this technique relies on the actual duration of previous similar projects as the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. it is a gross value estimating approach sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity. analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when there is a limited amount of detailed information about the project. analogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques but it is also less accurate. analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous activities are similar in fact and not just in appearance and the project team members preparing the estimates have the needed expertise. ,, analogous estimating ,",duration estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,cost estimating,estimating",",be,is,uses,is,is,is,uses,uses,uses",",phases,technique,size weight,techniques,activities,estimating technique,relationship,values,relationship"
106,ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS,Has_Technics_Tools,parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration based on historical data and project parameters. parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables e.g. square footage in construction to calculate an estimate for activity parameters such as cost budget and duration. part guide durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor hours per unit of work. for example duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by the number of labor hours per drawing or on a cable installation the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor hours per meter. if the assigned resource is capable of installing meters of cable per hour the duration required to install meters is hours meters divided by meters per hour. this technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project in conjunction with other estimating methods. ,, parametric estimating ,",duration estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,estimating,cost estimating,estimating",",be,is,uses,is,is,is,uses,uses,uses",",phases,technique,size weight,techniques,activities,estimating technique,relationship,values,relationship"

115,DEVELOP SCHEDULE,Has_Technics_Tools,the critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. this schedule network analysis technique calculates the early start early ﬁnish late start and late ﬁnish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations by performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network as shown in figure . in this example the longest path includes activities a c and d and therefore the sequence of acd is the critical path. the critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project which determines the shortest possible project duration. the longest path has the least total ﬂoatusually zero. the resulting early and late start and ﬁnish dates are not necessarily the project schedule rather they indicate the time periods within which the activity could be executed using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations logical relationships leads lags and other known constraints. the critical path method is used to calculate the critical paths and the amount of total and free ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. on any network path the total ﬂoat or schedule ﬂexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project ﬁnish date or violating a schedule constraint. a critical path is normally characterized by zero total ﬂoat on the critical path. as implemented with the precedence diagramming method sequencing critical paths may have positive zero or negative total ﬂoat depending on the constraints applied. positive total ﬂoat is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a schedule constraint that is later than the early ﬁnish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation. negative total ﬂoat is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. negative ﬂoat analysis is a technique that helps to ﬁnd possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track. schedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. many software packages allow the user to deﬁne the parameters used to determine the critical paths. adjustments to activity durations when more resources or less scope can be arranged logical relationships when the relationships were discretionary to begin with leads and lags or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total ﬂoat. once the total ﬂoat and the free ﬂoat have been calculated the free ﬂoat is the amount of time that a schedule activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. for example the free ﬂoat for activity b in figure is days. part guide b path abd start a d finish path acd c critical path key activity early early node start duration finish activity name late total late start float finish note this example uses the accepted convention of the project critical path link starting on day for calculating start and finish dates. there are noncritical path link other accepted conventions that may be used. figure . example of critical path method ,, critical path method ,",method,method,path,path,path,path,method,method",",is,takes,has,is,determines,is,assumes,is",",number,responsibility,highrisk activities,sequence,project duration,total,project,project schedule"

146,CONTROL COSTS,Has_Technics_Tools,data analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to earned value analysis eva. earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the actual schedule and cost performance. evm integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule baseline to form the performance measurement baseline. evm develops and monitors three key dimensions for each work package and control account nuplanned value. planned value pv is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. it is the authorized budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure wbs component not including management reserve. this budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project but at a given point in time planned value deﬁnes the physical work that should have been accomplished. the total of the pv is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline pmb. the total planned value for the project is also known as budget at completion bac. nuearned value. earned value ev is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work. it is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. the ev being measured needs to be related to the pmb and the ev measured cannot be greater than the authorized pv budget for a component. the ev is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. progress measurement criteria should be established for each wbs component to measure work in progress. project managers monitor ev both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long term performance trends. nuactual cost. actual cost ac is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a speciﬁc time period. it is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the ev measured. the ac needs to correspond in deﬁnition to what was budgeted in the pv and measured in the ev e.g. direct hours only direct costs only or all costs including indirect costs. the ac will have no upper limit whatever is spent to achieve the ev will be measured. variance analysis. variance analysis as used in evm is the explanation cause impact and corrective actions for cost cv ev ac schedule sv ev pv and variance at completion vac bac eac variances. cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements. for projects not using formal earned value analysis similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing planned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance. further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule baseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. cost performance measurements are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. an important aspect of project cost control includes determining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline see section ... and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. the percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to decrease as more work is accomplished. examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to nuschedule variance. schedule variance sv is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference between the earned value and the planned value. it is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind the planned delivery date at a given point in time. it is a measure of schedule performance on a project. it is equal to the earned value ev minus the planned value pv. the eva schedule variance is a useful metric in that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. the eva schedule variance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have been earned. schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method cpm scheduling and risk management. equation sv ev pv. nucost variance. cost variance cv is the amount of budget deﬁcit or surplus at a given point in time expressed as the difference between earned value and the actual cost. it is a measure of cost performance on a project. it is equal to the earned value ev minus the actual cost ac. the cost variance at the end of the project will be the difference between the budget at completion bac and the actual amount spent. the cv is particularly critical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. negative cv is often difﬁcult for the project to recover. equation cv ev ac. part guide nuschedule performance index. the schedule performance index spi is a measure of schedule efﬁciency expressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. it measures how efﬁciently the project team is accomplishing the work. it is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index cpi to forecast the ﬁnal project completion estimates. an spi value less than . indicates less work was completed than was planned. an spi greater than . indicates that more work was completed than was planned. since the spi measures all project work the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine whether the project will ﬁnish ahead of or behind its planned ﬁnish date. the spi is equal to the ratio of the ev to the pv. equation spi evpv. nucost performance index. the cost performance index cpi is a measure of the cost efﬁciency of budgeted resources expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. it is considered the most critical eva metric and measures the cost efﬁciency for the work completed. a cpi value of less than . indicates a cost overrun for work completed. a cpi value greater than . indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. the cpi is equal to the ratio of the ev to the ac. equation cpi evac. trend analysis. trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine if performance is improving or deteriorating. graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding performance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of bac versus estimate at completion eac and completion dates. examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to nucharts. in earned value analysis three parameters of planned value earned value and actual cost can be monitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis typically weekly or monthly and on a cumulative basis. figure uses scurves to display ev data for a project that is performing over budget and behind the schedule. project budget eac management

project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion eac that may differ from the budget at completion bac based on the project performance. if it becomes obvious that the bac is no longer viable the project manager should consider the forecasted eac. forecasting the eac involves making projections of conditions and events in the projects future based on current performance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. forecasts are generated updated and reissued based on work performance data section ... that is provided as the project is executed. the work performance information covers the projects past performance and any information that could impact the project in the future. eacs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed plus an estimate to complete etc the remaining work. it is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the etc based on its experience to date. earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the required eac costs. the most common eac forecasting approach is a manual bottomup summation by the project manager and project team. the project managers bottomup eac method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for the work completed and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. equation eac ac bottomup etc. part guide the project managers manual eac is quickly compared with a range of calculated eacs representing various risk scenarios. when calculating eac values the cumulative cpi and spi values are typically used. while evm data quickly provide many statistical eacs only three of the more common methods are described as follows mueac forecast for etc work performed at the budgeted rate. this eac method accepts the actual project performance to date whether favorable or unfavorable as represented by the actual costs and predicts that all future etc work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. when actual performance is unfavorable the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project risk analysis. equation eac ac bac ev. mueac forecast for etc work performed at the present cpi. this method assumes that what the project has experienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. the etc work is assumed to be performed at the same cumulative cost performance index cpi as that incurred by the project to date. equation eac bac cpi. mueac forecast for etc work considering both spi and cpi factors. in this forecast the etc work will be performed at an efﬁciency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. this method is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the etc effort. variations of this method weight the cpi and spi at different values e.g. or some other ratio according to the project managers judgment. equation eac ac bac ev cpi spi. reserve analysis. during cost control reserve analysis is used to monitor the status of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or if additional reserves need to be requested. as work on the project progresses these reserves may be used as planned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. conversely when opportunities are captured and resulting in cost savings funds may be added to the contingency amount or taken from the project as marginproﬁt. if the identiﬁed risks do not occur the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to free up resources for other projects or operations. additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need to request that

project will deliver the products services and results deﬁned in the project scope and serves as a tool for communication managing stakeholders expectations and as a basis for performance reporting. the project management team selects a scheduling method such as critical path or an agile approach. then the projectspeciﬁc data such as the activities planned dates durations resources dependencies and constraints are entered into a scheduling tool to create a schedule model for the project. the result is a project schedule. figure provides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method scheduling tool and outputs from the project schedule management processes interact to create a schedule model. for smaller projects deﬁning activities sequencing activities estimating activity durations and developing the schedule model are so tightly linked that they are viewed as a single process that can be performed by a person over a relatively short period of time. these processes are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and techniques for each process are different. some of these processes are presented more fully in the practice standard for scheduling . when possible the detailed project schedule should remain ﬂexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge gained increased understanding of the risk and valueadded activities. project specific data

with high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fastpaced highly competitive global marketplace where long term scope is difﬁcult to deﬁne it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective adoption and tailoring of development practices to respond to the changing needs of the environment. adaptive planning deﬁnes a plan but acknowledges that once work starts the priorities may change and the plan needs to reﬂect this new knowledge. some of the emerging practices for project scheduling methods include but are not limited to iterative scheduling with a backlog. this is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles such as the agile approach for product development. the requirements are documented in user stories that are then prioritized and reﬁned just prior to construction and the product features are developed using timeboxed periods of work. this approach is often used to deliver incremental value to the customer or when multiple teams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. this scheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive life cycles for product development. the beneﬁt of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the development life cycle. ondemand scheduling. this approach typically used in a kanban system is based on the theoryof constraints and pullbased scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a teams work in progress in order to balance demand against the teams delivery throughput. ondemand scheduling does not rely on a schedule that was developed previously for the development of the product or product increments but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources become available. ondemand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in operational or sustainment environments and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope or can be bundled by size and scope. tailoring considerations because each project is unique the project manager may need to tailor the way project schedule management processes are applied. considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to life cycle approach. what is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule resource availability. what are the factors inﬂuencing durations such as the correlation between available resources and their productivity project dimensions. how will the presence of project complexity technological uncertainty product novelty pace or progress tracking such as earned value percentage complete redyellowgreen stop light indicators impact the desired level of control technology support. is technology used to develop record transmit receive and store project schedule model information and is it readily accessible for more speciﬁc information regarding scheduling refer to the practice standard for scheduling . considerations for agileadaptive environments adaptive approaches use short cycles to undertake work review the results and adapt as necessary. these cycles provide rapid feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables and generally manifest as iterative scheduling and ondemand pullbased scheduling as discussed in the section on key trends and emerging practices in project schedule management. in large organizations there may be a mixture of small projects and large initiatives requiring longterm roadmaps to manage the development of these programs using scaling factors e.g. team size geographical distribution regulatory compliance organizational complexity and technical complexity. to address the full delivery life cycle for larger enterprisewide systems a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach adaptive approach or a hybrid of both may need to be adopted. the organization may need to combine practices from several core methods or adopt a method that has already done so and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques. the role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life cycle or managing projects in adaptive environments. however to be successful in using adaptive approaches the project manager will need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand how to apply them effectively. part guide . ,Section 4.4.3.1.

177,DEVELOP SCHEDULE,Has_outputs,the project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates durations milestones and resources. at a minimum the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned ﬁnish date for each activity. if resource planning is done at an early stage the project schedule remains preliminary until resource assignments have been conﬁrmed and scheduled start and ﬁnish dates are established. this process usually occurs no later than the completion of the project management plan section .... a target project schedule model may also be developed with a deﬁned target start and target ﬁnish for each activity. the project schedule may be presented in summary form sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule or presented in detail. although a project schedule model can be presented in tabular form it is more often presented graphically using one or more of the following formats bar charts. also known as gantt charts bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listed on the vertical axis dates are shown on the horizontal axis and activity durations are shown as horizontal bars placed according to start and ﬁnish dates. bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used. depending on the audience ﬂoat can be depicted or not. for control and management communications the broader more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent work packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. an example is the summary schedule portion of figure that is presented in a wbsstructured format. milestone charts. these charts are similar to bar charts but only identify the scheduled start or completion of major deliverables and key external interfaces. an example is the milestone schedule portion of figure . project schedule network diagrams. these diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnode diagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale sometimes referred to as a pure logic diagram as shown in figure or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format that is sometimes called a logic bar chart as shown for the detailed schedule in figure . these diagrams with activity date information usually show both the project network logic and the projects critical path schedule activities. this example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities. another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. these diagrams include a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. they are optimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the same line of the diagram in sequence. figure shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed with the work in progress reported through asof date or status date. for a simple project schedule model figure reﬂects schedule presentations in the forms of a milestone schedule as a milestone chart a summary schedule as a bar chart and a detailed schedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. figure also visually shows the relationships among the different levels of detail of the project schedule. part guide

guide project cost management project cost management includes the processes involved in planning estimating budgeting ﬁnancing funding managing and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. the project cost management processes are . plan cost managementthe process of deﬁning how the project costs will be estimated budgeted managed monitored and controlled. . estimate coststhe process of developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete project work. . determine budgetthe process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to establish an authorized cost baseline. . control coststhe process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and manage changes to the cost baseline. figure provides an overview of the project cost management processes. the project cost management processes are presented as discrete processes with deﬁned interfaces while in practice they overlap and interact in ways that cannot be completely detailed in the pmbok guide. these processes interact with each other and with processes in other knowledge areas. on some projects especially those of smaller scope cost estimating and cost budgeting are tightly linked and can be viewed as a single process that can be performed by a single person over a relatively short period of time. they are presented here as distinct processes because the tools and techniques for each are different. the ability to inﬂuence cost is greatest at the early stages of the project making early

figure . project cost management overview part guide key concepts for project cost management project cost management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project activities. project cost management should consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using maintaining and supporting the product service or result of the project. for example limiting the number of design reviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting products operating costs. another aspect of cost management is recognizing that different stakeholders measure project costs in different ways and at different times. for example the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision is made or committed the order is placed the item is delivered or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project accounting purposes. in many organizations predicting and analyzing the prospective ﬁnancial performance of the projects product is performed outside of the project. in others such as a capital facilities project project cost management can include this work. when such predictions and analyses are included project cost management may address additional processes and numerous general ﬁnancial management techniques such as return on investment discounted cash ﬂow and investment payback analysis. trends and emerging practices in project cost management within the practice of project cost management trends include the expansion of earned value management evm to include the concept of earned schedule es. es is an extension to the theory and practice of evm. earned schedule theory replaces the schedule variance measures used in traditional evm earned value planned value with es and actual time at. using the alternate equation for calculating schedule variance es at if the amount of earned schedule is greater than then the project is considered ahead of schedule. in other words the project earned more than planned at a given point in time. the schedule performance index spi using earned schedule metrics is esat. this indicates the efﬁciency with which work is being accomplished. earned schedule theory also provides formulas for forecasting the project completion date using earned schedule actual time and estimated duration. tailoring considerations because each project is unique the project manager may need to tailor the way project cost management processes are applied. considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to knowledge management. does the organization have a formal knowledge management and ﬁnancial database repository that a project manager is required to use and that is readily accessible estimating and budgeting. does the organization have existing formal or informal cost estimating and budgetingrelated policies procedures and guidelines earned value management. does the organization use earned value management in managing projects use of agile approach. does the organization use agile methodologies in managing projects how does this impact cost estimating governance. does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies procedures and guidelines considerations for agileadaptive environments projects with high degrees of uncertainty or those where the scope is not yet fully deﬁned may not beneﬁt from detailed cost calculations due to frequent changes. instead lightweight estimation methods can be used to generate a fast highlevel forecast of project labor costs which can then be easily adjusted as changes arise. detailed estimates are reserved for shortterm planning horizons in a justintime fashion. in cases where highvariability projects are also subject to strict budgets the scope and schedule are more often adjusted to stay within cost constraints. part guide . ,Section 4.1.3.2.
